    about: `I'm Rajesh Pedagoni, a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications and distributed systems across fintech, healthcare, and e-commerce domains. I specialize in designing robust APIs, developing microservices, and delivering real-time solutions using modern frameworks like Spring Boot, Node.js, and React.

From deploying cloud-native apps on AWS to optimizing backend performance with Kafka, Redis, and GraphQL, I focus on writing clean, efficient code that solves real-world problems. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy turning complex requirements into elegant, maintainable solutions.

Currently based in Kansas City, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science while building impactful products that blend performance, security, and great user experience.`
